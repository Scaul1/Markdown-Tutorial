//To create a new paragraph, add two spaces after the line of text.  
//This is called a soft break ( a hard break would be adding another space and therefore separating paragraphs with another blank line). 
//You can't see the spaces but must type them. 

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
